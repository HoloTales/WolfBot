This project is a personal discord bot for the purpose of testing and implementing FFXIV-based and other discord-based features.

This project is not meant to be used elsewhere but if there is a desire to, as the license states, you are free to use it anywhere.

The dependencies are built with gradle and only require the JDA library and Gradle Library.
Currently the java version required is 11.x due to it's support of a in built HTTP client.
This may be changed in the future as builds become more common, but for now this will be the standard.
Do note that this program contacts external hosts such as discord and random.org.
